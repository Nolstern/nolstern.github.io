    <h1>Google's June 2025 Core Update – What Beginners Should Know</h1>
    <p class="read-time">🕒 5 min read</p>

    <p>If you're learning SEO right now, you're entering at a key moment. Google's June 2025 Core Update just rolled out, and it's already shifting how rankings work. This post breaks down what changed, how to know if your site was affected, and how beginners can respond without getting overwhelmed.</p>

    <h2>What Changed in the June 2025 Update?</h2>
    <p>Google continues to emphasize content quality and trust. Sites with thin content, outdated information, or over-optimized formatting saw a drop in visibility. On the other hand, helpful content — even from small blogs — performed better when it provided clear, well-written answers to user questions.</p>

    <h2>How to Know if You Were Affected</h2>
    <p>Check your traffic in Google Search Console or GA4. If impressions or clicks dropped sharply between June 5 and June 13, your site may have been impacted. Focus on trends, not daily swings, and look closely at which pages lost visibility.</p>

    <h2>What the Experts Are Noticing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Search now favors content that answers real questions clearly.</li>
      <li>Outdated tactics like keyword stuffing or irrelevant linking aren't working anymore.</li>
      <li>Smaller sites with strong writing are doing better than some bigger brands in specific searches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beginner-Friendly Actions to Take</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update older content:</strong> Make sure your posts reflect the current year, tools, and best practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve your best pages:</strong> Focus on a few strong posts instead of many shallow ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Write naturally:</strong> Avoid robotic or keyword-heavy sentences. Prioritize clarity and tone.</li>
      <li><strong>Use internal links:</strong> Help readers and search engines find related content on your site. Try linking to your <a href="../seo-strategy.html">SEO strategy</a> if it fits.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch engagement data:</strong> GA4 reports like user retention and average engagement time can help you track real improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>This update continues a clear trend — Google is rewarding helpful content, not shortcuts. If you're building your skills, focus on writing clearly, organizing your content well, and staying up to date with basic tracking tools. Each update is a chance to improve.</p>
